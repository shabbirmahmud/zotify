<details><summary>Full installation instructions with FFmpeg</summary>

<details><summary>Windows</summary>

This guide uses *Scoop* (https://scoop.sh) to simplify installing prerequisites and *pipx* to manage Zotify itself. 
There are other ways to install and run Zotify on Windows but this is the official recommendation, other methods of installation will not receive support.

- Open PowerShell (cmd will not work)
- Install Scoop by running:
  - `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
  - `irm get.scoop.sh | iex`
- After installing scoop run: `scoop install python ffmpeg-shared git`
- Install pipx:
  - `python3 -m pip install --user pipx`
  - `python3 -m pipx ensurepath`
- Now close PowerShell and reopen it to ensure the pipx command is available. Proceed to install zotify using either of the commands below.
</details>

<details><summary>macOS</summary>

- Open the Terminal app
- Install *Homebrew* (https://brew.sh) by running: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
- After installing Homebrew run: `brew install python@3.11 pipx ffmpeg git`
- Setup pipx: `pipx ensurepath`
- Proceed to install zotify using either of the commands below.
</details>

<details><summary>Linux (Most Popular Distributions)</summary>

### Compatibility with official version

Do note that `--skip-previous` and `--skip-duplicates` won't immediately work with playlists and albums downloaded using the official version (both dev and main branches). To make the playlist/album compatible with this fork such that `--skip-previous` and `--skip-duplicates` will both work, simply add the `-m` or `--match` flag to the download command. This will try to match filenames present in the library to ones that are to be downloaded. Note that output formats should match between the current download command and the existing files.

For example:
```
zotify -m <playlist/album_url>
zotify -m -p
zotify -m -d <text_file_with_urls_to_download>
```
This only needs to be done once per existing album or playlist.


### More about search

- `-c` or `--category` can be used to limit search results to certain categories.
  - Available categories are "album", "artist", "playlist", "track", "show" and "episode".
  - You can search in multiple categories at once
- You can also narrow down results by using field filters in search queries
  - Currently available filters are album, artist, track, year, upc, tag:hipster, tag:new, isrc, and genre.
  - Available filters are album, artist, track, year, upc, tag:hipster, tag:new, isrc, and genre.
  - The artist and year filters can be used while searching albums, artists and tracks. You can filter on a single year or a range (e.g. 1970-1982).
  - The album filter can be used while searching albums and tracks.
  - The genre filter can be used while searching artists and tracks.
  - The isrc and track filters can be used while searching tracks.
  - The upc, tag:new and tag:hipster filters can only be used while searching albums. The tag:new filter will return albums released in the past two weeks and tag:hipster can be used to show only albums in the lowest 10% of popularity.

## Usage as a library

Zotify can be used as a user-friendly library for saving music, podcasts, lyrics and metadata.

Here's a very simple example of downloading a track and its metadata:

```python
from zotify import Session

session = Session.from_userpass(username="username", password="password")
track = session.get_track("4cOdK2wGLETKBW3PvgPWqT")
output = track.create_output("./Music", "{artist} - {title}")

file = track.write_audio_stream(output)

file.write_metadata(track.metadata)
file.write_cover_art(track.get_cover_art())
file.clean_filename()
```

## Contributing

Pull requests are always welcome, but if adding an entirely new feature we encourage you to create an issue proposing the feature first so we can ensure it's something that fits the scope of the project.
